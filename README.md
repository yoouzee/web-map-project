Welcome!

This is a simple, responsive map that displays different demographic data at the planning area level in Singapore.

There are a total of 55 planning areas in Singapore. 28 planning areas, with a population of 15,000 or greater, are displayed on this map.

Toggle the metrics below to refresh the map visualization. Hover over the map to select a planning area and update metric values.

I hope you will be able to learn/discover spatial trends in different demographic indicators across the different planning areas of Singapore.
